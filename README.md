# Welcome to SPECTRALib!

SPECTRALib is a 100% python library with minimal dependencies (`numpy` and `matplotlib`) for handling filterbank files and generating synthetic transients such as pulsars and FRBs, mixed with RFI and other effects.

### Feel free to use the code however you wish:
 - You can `import spectralib` and use the functions in your code
 - You can modify the **example scripts** to generate files that fit your requirement
 - The functions should be modular enough to **copy and paste** into your own code
